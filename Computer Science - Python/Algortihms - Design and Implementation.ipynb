    "# Design and Implement Algorithms (Greedy Interval Scheduling, 7 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "In interval scheduling, we are given a set of tasks \\( \\{j_1, j_2, j_3, \\ldots, j_n\\} \\) that each start at time \\( s_j \\) and finish at time \\( f_j \\). A processor can only work on one task at a time. Please find provably optimal greedy strategies for the following two interval scheduling tasks, and implement them in Python. In your implementation, the problem instance should be described as a dictionary, whose keys are the job IDs and whose values are pairs of start and finish times. For example, one possible instance, illustrated in Figure 1, would be \\( \\{a : (0, 6), b : (1, 4), c : (3, 5), d : (3, 8), e : (4, 7), f : (5, 9), g : (6, 10), h : (8, 11)\\} \\).\n",

    "### a) Single Processor Interval Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that only a single processor is available. Select a subset of tasks so that they are compatible (i.e., none of them overlap with each other), and that the number of selected tasks is optimal, i.e., any larger subset would contain at least one incompatible pair of tasks. (2P)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** As indicated in Figure 1, the optimal subset in this example would be \\( \\{b, e, h\\} \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### b) Minimum Number of Processors\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the minimum number of processors that is required to complete all tasks. Output a feasible assignment of tasks to this number of processors. (3P)\n",
    "\n",
    "### c) Time Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the tasks above, present the time complexity and explain it. (2P)\n"
